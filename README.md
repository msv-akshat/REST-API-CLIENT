## Overview
*WeatherApp* is a command-line Java application designed to provide real-time weather data for any city using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/). The application integrates JSON parsing through the org.json library to efficiently extract and display weather details such as temperature, weather conditions, and city information.

This project aims to deliver a simple yet powerful weather forecasting solution with a focus on error handling, data accuracy, and seamless user interaction via a command-line interface (CLI).

## Key Features
- *Real-Time Data Fetching:* The application retrieves current weather conditions directly from the OpenWeather API for any valid city name provided by the user.
- *Accurate Data Display:* Displays essential details like city name, temperature, and weather conditions.
- *Error Handling:* Ensures robust error management to handle invalid city names, network failures, and API-related issues.
- *Lightweight and Efficient:* Designed to be a minimal yet powerful CLI application for quick weather updates.
- *User-Friendly Interface:* Clear and concise data presentation for improved usability.

## Technologies Used
- *Java* (Primary programming language)

1. Sign up at [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).
2. Generate an API key from your profile dashboard.
3. Replace the apiKey variable in WeatherApp.java with your generated key.

java
String apiKey = "<YOUR_API_KEY>";


## Error Handling
- If the city name is invalid or misspelled, the program will gracefully handle the error and prompt the user accordingly.
- API errors such as rate limits or network failures are also managed to ensure smoothÂ execution.
